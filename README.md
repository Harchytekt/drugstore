# drugstore

codIT is a web drugstore were the users can create a list of given medicines.

This is one of the projects of my second year at the Haute Ã‰cole en Hainaut for the _Web programming_ course.

It's written in HTML/CSS and PHP. There're some JavaScript _(and jQuery)_ effects.  
The database was created with MySQL.  

The code is [here](site).  
And the report is [here](https://github.com/Harchytekt/Rapports/blob/master/2015-2018%20(HeH)/2016-2017/PHP/Rapport.pdf).
