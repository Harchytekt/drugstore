# drugstore

codIT is a web drugstore were the users can create a list of given medicines.

This is one of the projects of my second year at the Haute Ã‰cole en Hainaut for the _Web programming_ course.

It's written in HTML/CSS and PHP. There're some JavaScript _(and jQuery)_ effects.  
The database was created with MySQL.
